# Legacy Code Archive

This folder contains early development files from the original SYNTRA builds,
including logic written during the transition from Jarvis to the current symbolic system.

These scripts represent:
- Pre-VLD diagnostic logic
- Early procedural versions of MODI and memory tagging
- Explorations of fault detection before symbolic compression was standardized

While no longer used in the active codebase, they are preserved for transparency,
reference, and to document the system's symbolic evolution.
