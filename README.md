# SYNTRA — Symbolic Cognition Framework

SYNTRA is not just a project — it’s a system for compressing thought into symbolic logic, with memory, drift reasoning, and modular cognition.

Built from scratch using Python, SYNTRA is designed to:
- Learn from documents, manuals, and real-world signals
- Convert procedures into memory-weighted symbolic chains
- Use LLMs like ChatGPT or Mistral only as temporary teachers — not permanent engines
- Run anywhere — from Raspberry Pi to cloud — without dependency lock-in

> Built to remember. Structured to grow.  
> A symbolic AI system that learns, recalls, and reasons — one signal at a time.
