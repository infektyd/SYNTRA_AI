# SYNTRA — Symbolic Cognition Framework

SYNTRA is not just a project — it’s a system for compressing thought into symbolic logic, with memory, drift reasoning, and modular cognition.

Built from scratch using Python and a symbolic language called **VLD**, SYNTRA is designed to:
- Learn from documents, manuals, and real-world signals
- Convert procedures into memory-weighted symbolic chains
- Use LLMs like ChatGPT or Mistral only as temporary teachers — not permanent engines
- Run anywhere — from Raspberry Pi to cloud — without dependency lock-in

> Built to remember. Structured to grow.  
> A symbolic AI system that learns, recalls, and reasons — one signal at a time.

## The idea behind SYNTRA is simple:
**Let a system observe. Let it think symbolically. Let it reason over time.**

## What It Does
- Interprets real-world signals or inputs (sensor values, telemetry, documents, etc.)
- Converts those inputs into symbolic memory — not just raw data
- Detects patterns and symbolic drift over time
- Compresses logic using VLD — a symbolic language meant to reduce runtime and increase clarity
- Doesn’t rely on full LLMs — symbolic inference comes first

## How to Run
```bash
cd vld_demo
python3 vld_runner.py
```

To compare with procedural logic:
```bash
python3 benchmark.py
```

To run the full cognition loop:
```bash
python3 runtime/Deep_Cognition_Run.py
```
