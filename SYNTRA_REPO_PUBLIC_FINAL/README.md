# SYNTRA: Symbolic Cognition Framework

SYNTRA is a modular symbolic AI system Iâ€™ve been developing from scratch â€” combining symbolic memory, modular reasoning, and compression logic. Itâ€™s designed to simulate cognitive processes using GPT-based scaffolding and a custom language called VLD (Variable Logic Descriptor).

This isnâ€™t a neural net experiment. Itâ€™s a working symbolic cognition engine that:
- Interprets real-world sensor data (like vehicle diagnostics)
- Tracks symbolic drift over time
- Compresses complex decision logic into a few symbolic lines
- Runs lean on devices like Raspberry Pi
